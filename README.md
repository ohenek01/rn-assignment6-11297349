## Shopping App
This is a simple shopping app built with React Native. It allows users to view a list of products, add products to their cart, remove products from their cart, and view the items in their cart.
## Design Choices
* React Navigation: Used for navigation between screens (HomeScreen and Checkout).
* Context API: Utilized to manage the global state of the cart, providing a seamless way to update and access the cart data across different components.
* AsyncStorage: Implemented for persistent storage of cart items, ensuring the cart state is maintained even when the app is closed and reopened.
* Styling: Used StyleSheet for consistent and maintainable styling of components.
* Vector Icons: Included vector icons for a more interactive and visually appealing user interface.
